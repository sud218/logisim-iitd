# logisim-iitd
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/logisim-iitd

Originally created BY C. Burch, we have adopted Georgia tech's version of Logisim and integrated the Floating-Point Components within the Arithmetic Unit. Since the earlier version could be used only for integer numbers, this new Logisim-IITD can be used to do arithmetic operations even for IEEE-754 single precision floating point numbers with the help of functions like:

FPAdder: Adds two Floating point numbers. FPSubtractor: Subtracts two FP numbers. FPMultiplier: Multiplies two FP numbers. FPDivider: Divides two FP numbers. FPComparator: Compares two FP numbers. FPNegator: Negates a FP number. BinToFP: Converts a binary number to its corresponding IEEE-754 single precision Floating Point number. FPToBin: Converts an FP number to its decimal format.

This new version is used by the students in IIT Delhi and other universities as a part of their curriculum.
